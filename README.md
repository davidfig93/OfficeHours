### Display

When navigating to the application, this is the page that first opens up. The main purpose of this page is to have it displayed somewhere where it is visible to the people waiting for their turn to speak to a staff member. The view shows the list of people waiting to see each currently available staff member in order of arrival. No other functionality is available to this page other than to go to the login page as there is no login required to view it.

### Admin

When logged in as admin user, youa re directed to the admin page. The page includes a series of fields to fill out to add visitors to the queues. The page also includes all of the current staff members in the database with the ability to show them or hide them from the display view. The admin page also includes a full view of all of the staff members lists and the ability to check them off the lists.

### Staff

#### Queues
The default page when logging in as a staff member is the staff queues page. This page has all of the staff members' lists with the comments logged from the admin page as well as the ability to mark people as seen on all lists.

#### History
